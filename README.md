Routines for semi-automated grading of MATLAB coding assignments and interaction with Canvas and Qualtrics.

By Dmitry Savransky with contributions by Guy Hoffman and Brian Kirby. Thanks also to Hadas Ritz for extensive testing and QA.

Please note: the Canvas routines have the potential to bork your gradebook and (unlikely but possibly) whole course site. **Use at your own risk**.
